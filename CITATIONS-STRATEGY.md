# Citation Strategy for Nationwide Service Marketplace

## Overview
Since you don't have a single physical location but operate nationwide with service areas everywhere, you'll need a strategic approach to citations.

## Citation Approaches

### 1. **Virtual Office / Registered Agent Address**
- Use your business registration address (LLC/Corp registered address)
- This gives you ONE consistent NAP (Name, Address, Phone) for major directories
- Good for: Google Business Profile (Service Area Business), Yelp, BBB

### 2. **Service Area Business (SAB) Model**
Most citation sites now support Service Area Businesses:

#### Google Business Profile
- Set up as "Service Area Business"
- Hide your address (if home-based)
- Add all your service areas (cities/states)
- You can add up to 20 service areas

#### Bing Places for Business
- Similar to Google - supports SAB
- Add multiple service areas

#### Apple Maps Connect
- Supports service area businesses
- Can specify regions you serve

### 3. **City-Specific Landing Pages Strategy**
Create citations for your top markets:

```
Business Name: Hometown Dumpster Rental - Richmond
Address: Serving Richmond, VA and surrounding areas
Phone: Use tracking numbers for each city (or main number)
```

### 4. **Industry-Specific Directories**
Focus on directories that understand service-based businesses:

#### Construction/Contractor Directories
- HomeAdvisor (no address required)
- Angie's List / Angi (service areas)
- Thumbtack (zip codes served)
- Houzz (for contractors)
- BuildZoom
- Porch.com

#### Waste Management Specific
- Waste Dive directory
- Construction Equipment Guide
- ForConstructionPros.com

#### Local Service Directories
