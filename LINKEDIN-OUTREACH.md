#### Follow-Up #2 (3 days later if no response)
```
Hi [Name],

Quick update - just had a provider in [nearby city] tell me they closed 8 jobs from 12 leads last week.

Their cost? About $25 per lead using our credit system. 
Compare that to HomeAdvisor at $75+ for shared leads.

We're getting 200+ searches/month for "dumpster rental [City]" and I'd rather send them to you than your competitors.

5 minutes to discuss?

#### Follow-Up #3 (7 days later - final attempt)

[Name], last quick note -

Your competitor [Competitor Name] just asked about getting more leads in [City].

Before I talk to them, wanted to give you first shot since you have better reviews.

If interested, just reply "YES" and I'll send details.

Otherwise, no worries and best of luck!

#### Follow-Up #2 (3 days later if no response)
```
Hi [Name],

Just locked in an exclusive partner for [nearby city] - they're getting ALL 47 leads/month in their area.

No competition. No bidding wars. Just them.

[City] is still available with 30-50 monthly searches.

Want to claim it before someone else does?

Takes 5 minutes to explain how exclusive territories work.

[Your name]
```

#### Follow-Up #3 (7 days later - final attempt)
```
[Name], fair warning -

I have 2 other dumpster companies asking about exclusive rights to [City].

You were my first choice because of your reputation.

If you want [City] as your exclusive territory, just reply "INTERESTED" and I'll hold it for you.

Otherwise I'll move forward with the others.

[Your name]
P.S. Once someone else gets exclusive rights, that's it - you're locked out.
```

### Message 2: Case Study Approach
```
Hi [Name],

Thanks for connecting! Thought you might find this interesting:

Just helped Royal Rolloffs (Richmond, VA) with:
- 47 exclusive leads last month
- 31 booked jobs
- $18,500 in revenue
- They paid us $1,480 (8% of closed deals only)

Compare that to HomeAdvisor:
- 47 leads × $75 = $3,525 upfront
- Shared with 4+ competitors
- Maybe 8-10 bookings if lucky

We have [number] monthly searches for dumpster rentals in [City] and need ONE trusted provider.

15 minutes to see if this makes sense for you?

```

### Message 3: Soft Approach
```
Hi [Name],

I noticed you've been in the dumpster rental business for [X years] - impressive! 

I'm curious - what's your biggest challenge with online lead generation right now?

Most providers tell me it's:
1. Lead quality from HomeAdvisor/Angi
2. Competing with multiple companies for same lead
3. High upfront cost per lead

We've built something different - exclusive leads, pay only on closed deals.

Would you be open to a brief conversation about your current lead flow? Even if we're not a fit, I might be able to share some insights that help.

## What Makes These Work:

### Key Triggers:
1. **Exclusive leads** - They HATE sharing leads
2. **No upfront fees** - They're tired of paying for bad leads
3. **Local focus** - Shows you understand their market
4. **Specific numbers** - 30-50 leads, 8-10% commission
5. **Anti-HomeAdvisor** - Most have been burned
6. **Scarcity** - "ONE provider per area"

## Subject Lines That Get Responses:

- "Question about your dumpster rental leads"
- "Exclusive [City] leads - no competition"
- "Alternative to HomeAdvisor for [Company Name]"
- "47 exclusive leads → 31 bookings (Richmond provider)"
- "Your competitors might take this deal..."

## Follow-Up Strategy Tips

### Timing
- **Message 1**: Immediately after they accept connection
- **Message 2**: 3 days later (skip weekends)
- **Message 3**: 7 days after Message 1
- **Stop**: After 3 attempts with no response

### Personalization Points
- Check their Google reviews first - mention their rating
- Look up actual competitors in their city
- Reference real local landmarks or areas
- Check if they're running Google Ads (shows they invest in leads)

### Response Handlers

**If they say "We use HomeAdvisor":**
```
Perfect - then you know the pain of shared leads. Our providers typically close 2-3x more of our leads since there's no competition. Plus with our credit system, you control your spend. Quick call to compare numbers?
```

**If they say "Not interested":**
```
No problem! Mind if I ask - are you getting enough quality leads currently, or just not looking to change providers? (Sometimes the feedback helps us improve)
```

**If they say "Too expensive":**
```
I hear you. What are you paying per lead now? Most providers save 40-60% switching from HomeAdvisor to our credit system. Happy to run the numbers with you.
```

**If they say "Send me info":**
```
Will do! But honestly, a 5-minute call would be better - I can show you exactly how many searches we get in [City] and what your competitors are doing. Tomorrow at 2pm work?
```

## Pro Tips:

1. **Check their website first** - Mention something specific
2. **Look for pain signals** - Bad reviews about response time (they need more leads)
3. **Time it right** - Tuesday-Thursday, 10am-2pm
4. **Follow up exactly 3 times** - More is spam, less leaves money on the table
5. **Add value** - Share local market insights even if they don't respond
6. **Create urgency** - Exclusive territories and competitor mentions work
7. **Track everything** - Which messages, which cities, which times get responses

## A/B Test Variables:

- Pain-focused vs. Gain-focused
- Specific numbers vs. General claims  
- Formal vs. Casual tone
- Short vs. Detailed
- Question vs. Statement opening

## Red Flags to Avoid:

❌ "Revolutionary platform"
❌ "Uber of dumpster rentals"  
❌ "Disruptive technology"
❌ Too many buzzwords
❌ Being vague about the model

## Green Flags to Include:

✅ Specific competitor comparison (HomeAdvisor)
✅ Real numbers and results
✅ Pay-for-performance model
✅ Exclusive territory
✅ Quick implementation

## The "Pattern Interrupt" Message:

```
Hi [Name],

I'll be honest - you probably get pitched lead gen services all the time.

Here's why we're different in 10 seconds:

• HomeAdvisor: $75/lead → shared with 5 companies → you close 20%
• Us: $0/lead → exclusive to you → pay 8% only on closed deals

If you're booking less than 30 dumpster rentals/month, I can probably help.

Worth a chat?

[Your name]
P.S. We're talking to [Competitor Name] too, but I reached out to you first because [specific reason - better reviews, longer in business, etc.]
